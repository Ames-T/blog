I am Ames Turner.
I am a programming-oriented mathematician who enjoys complex problems and turning abstract ideas into code. I'm especially interested in the ways programmatic thinking can support mathematics, and vice versa.

I am a final-year mathematics student, currently focused on my dissertation in analytical number theory, exploring Legendre's conjecture on consecutive squares. My mathematical interests, however, extend across much of the discipline.

My blog includes work in mathematics, programming, and exploratory projects driven by curiosity. Beyond technical work, I enjoy learning for its own sake and spending time on hobbies that balance theory with hands-on, practical skills, including gaming, sewing, and woodwork.
